Preselm
=======

A tool for creating presentations in Elm

In order to make a presentation, create an Elm file with the presenation content, for example `my-presentation.elm` and compile together with the Preselm.elm file. Here is how you could do it:

    elm --make my-presentation.elm Preselm.elm

If the compilation is successful, the `my-presentation.html` file with your presentation should be created.
